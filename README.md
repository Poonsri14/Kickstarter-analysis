From these plots, we can see that the mean campaign goal is around £4,000. This is outside of the range of outliers for amount pledged, so Louise should probably try to get her play produced for less than £4,000. Half of the campaign goals are less than £2,000, which is just over the 3rd quartile for amounts pledged. The lower quartile of pledges starts on the x-axis, which means 25% of the Kickstarter campaigns for musicals in Great Britain got no funding at all.
